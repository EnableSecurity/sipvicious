.TP
\fB\-P\fR PORT, \fB\-\-localport\fR=\fIPORT\fR
Source port for our packets
.TP
\fB\-x\fR IP, \fB\-\-externalip\fR=\fIIP\fR
IP Address to use as the external ip. Specify this if
you have multiple interfaces or if you are behind NAT
.TP
\fB\-b\fR BINDINGIP, \fB\-\-bindingip\fR=\fIBINDINGIP\fR
By default we bind to all interfaces. This option
overrides that and binds to the specified ip address
.TP
\fB\-t\fR SELECTTIME, \fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fISELECTTIME\fR
This option allows you to trottle the speed at which
packets are sent. Change this if you're losing
packets. For example try 0.5.

resume a previous scan and allows you to export scans
.TP
\fB\-\-resume\fR=\fINAME\fR
resume a previous scan
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-enablecompact\fR
enable compact mode. Makes packets smaller but
possibly less compatible

\fB\-u\fR USERNAME, \fB\-\-username\fR=\fIUSERNAME\fR
username to try crack
.TP
\fB\-d\fR DICTIONARY, \fB\-\-dictionary\fR=\fIDICTIONARY\fR
specify a dictionary file with passwords
.TP
\fB\-r\fR RANGE, \fB\-\-range\fR=\fIRANGE\fR

\&... 9999
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-reusenonce\fR
Reuse nonce. Some SIP devices don't mind you reusing
the nonce (making them vulnerable to replay attacks).
Speeds up the cracking.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR TEMPLATE, \fB\-\-template\fR=\fITEMPLATE\fR
A format string which allows us to specify a template
for the extensions                       example
svwar.py \fB\-e\fR 1\-999 \fB\-\-template=\fR"123%#04i999" would scan
between 1230001999 to 1230999999"
.TP
\fB\-\-maximumtime\fR=\fIMAXIMUMTIME\fR
Maximum time in seconds to keep sending requests
without                       receiving a response
