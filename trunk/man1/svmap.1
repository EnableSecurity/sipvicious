.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show program's version number and exit
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Increase verbosity
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Quiet mode
.TP
\fB\-p\fR PORT, \fB\-\-port\fR=\fIPORT\fR
Destination port or port ranges of the SIP device \- eg
\fB\-p5060\fR,5061,8000\-8100
.TP
\fB\-P\fR PORT, \fB\-\-localport\fR=\fIPORT\fR
Source port for our packets
.TP
\fB\-x\fR IP, \fB\-\-externalip\fR=\fIIP\fR
IP Address to use as the external ip. Specify this if
you have multiple interfaces or if you are behind NAT
.TP
\fB\-b\fR BINDINGIP, \fB\-\-bindingip\fR=\fIBINDINGIP\fR
By default we bind to all interfaces. This option
overrides that and binds to the specified ip address
.TP
\fB\-t\fR SELECTTIME, \fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fISELECTTIME\fR
This option allows you to trottle the speed at which
packets are sent. Change this if you're losing
packets. For example try 0.5.

.TP
\fB\-\-resume\fR=\fINAME\fR
resume a previous scan
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-enablecompact\fR
enable compact mode. Makes packets smaller but
possibly less compatible
.TP
\fB\-\-randomscan\fR
Scan random IP addresses
.TP
\fB\-i\fR scan1, \fB\-\-input\fR=\fIscan1\fR
Scan IPs which were found in a previous scan. Pass the

.TP
\fB\-I\fR scan1, \fB\-\-inputtext\fR=\fIscan1\fR
Scan IPs from a text file \- use the same syntax as
command line but with new lines instead of commas.
Pass the file name as the argument
.TP
\fB\-m\fR METHOD, \fB\-\-method\fR=\fIMETHOD\fR
Specify the request method \- by default this is
OPTIONS.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Print SIP messages received
.TP
\fB\-\-first\fR=\fIFIRST\fR
Only send the first given number of messages (i.e.
usually used to scan only X IPs)
.TP
\fB\-e\fR EXTENSION, \fB\-\-extension\fR=\fIEXTENSION\fR
Specify an extension \- by default this is not set
.TP
\fB\-\-randomize\fR
Randomize scanning instead of scanning consecutive ip
addresses
.TP
\fB\-\-srv\fR
Scan the SRV records for SIP on the destination domain
name.The targets have to be domain names \- example.org
