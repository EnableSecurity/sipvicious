v0.2.3
* Feature:  Fingerprinting support for svmap. Included fphelper.py and 
            3 databases used for fingerprinting. 

* Feature:  Added svlearnfp.py which allows one to add new signatures to 
            db and send them to the author.
            
* Feature:  Added DNS SRV check to svmap. Use ./svmap.py --srv domainname.com
            to give it a try

v0.2.svn
* Feature:  added the ability for svreport to count results when doing a list

* Bug fix:  fixed a bug related to resuming a scan which does not have an
	    an extension

v0.2.1 (maintenance)
General:
* Feature:  updated the report function to include more information about
	    the system. Python version and operating system is now included 
	    in the bug report. option now supports optional feedback.

* Feature:  Store information about the state of a session. Sessions can be 
	complete or incomplete, so that you can resume incomplete sessions 
	but not complete ones.

* Feature:  Added -e option to svmap. Allows you to specify an extension. This
	is useful when using -m INVITE options on a SIP phone.

* Bug fix:  Added a check to make sure that the python version is supported. 
	Anything less than version 2.4 is not supported

* Bug fix:  IP in the SIP msg was being set to localhost when not explicitly 
	set. This is not correct behavior and was fixed. As a result of this 
	behavior some devices, such as Grandstream BT100 were not being detected.
	Thanks to robert&someone from bulgaria for reporting this

* Bug fix:  fixed a bug in the database which was reported anonymously via the --reportback / -R option.
	Thanks whoever reported that. Bug concerns the dbm which does not
	support certain methods supported other database modules referenced
	by anydbm. Reproduced on FreeBSD. Thanks to Anthony Williams for help i
	dentifying this

* Bug fix:  Ranges of extensions in svwar could not take long numeric extensions
	(xrange does not support long / large numbers). Thanks to Joern for reporting this

* Bug fix:  svwar was truncating extension names containing certain characters. Fixed.

* Bug fix:  when binding to a specific interface, the IP within the SIP message could be incorrect (when there are multiple interfaces). This has been fixed.

* Cosmetic: Certain PBXs reply with "603 Declined" when svwar finds that the
	extension does not exist. This creates extra noise. It is now being
	suppressed.

v0.2
General:
* Feature: replaced 3rd party functions in ip4range with our functions in helper.py
* Feature: ReportBack function is off by default but can be enabled by using -R option
* Feature: verbose and quiet mode. Now making use of logging module
* Newtool: svreport - export to csv, pdf, xml and plain text. 
* Feature: session / database support. This allows two things:
	- resuming of previous scans
	- exporting the results to more meaningful formats
* Feature: give a warning when the default port is already being used and listen on another port


Svmap:
* Feature: Host arguments now accepts a variety of formats. You can now scan using ranges like the following:
	- 1.1.1.1-20 1.1.1-20.1-10
	- 1.1.1.*
	- 1.1.1.1-1.1.2.20
	- sipvicious.org/22
* Bug fix: Generation of hosts to scan is now dynamic and does not slow down startup time
* Feature: Now making use of the standard logging module with more logging to debug problems
* Feature: When the port is already bound, svmap tries to listen on another port
* Feature: Added options to allow you to specify the ip to bind to as well as the external ip address of the scanner
* Feature: --help now shows proper usage
* Feature: New scanning method - random scan! This scans only valid internet address space.
* Feature: Randomize scan. Allows you to randomize the order of the IP addresses to be scanned. 

Svwar:
* Bug fix: Svwar was missing valid extensions (false negatives) - fixed
* Bug fix: Logic bug which did not identify between a server that does not respond and one that sends an unexpected response.
